# Movie-ratings-recommendation-system-in-Python


Built a movie rating recommendation system using collaborative filtering for predicting user’s ratings for all
the movies they have not seen.

Designed three algorithms based on distances, user’s gender and movie genre to predict ratings from top 50
similar users to our target, who have watched that movie.

A movie lens having 100k and 10 million data points were used and a Mean absolute difference value of 0.8
and 0.9 respectively was achieved as a measure of accuracy.
